# project-2

## What the project does
This project is an app that allows users to search for movies in the OMDB, and add the movies to the user's watch list (On Deck). The displayed movies also have 3 buttons for additional functionality - "Watched" will add the movie to the "Watched" list, "Preview" will allow the user to watch the associated trailer for the movie, and "Delete" which deletes the movie from that particular list.

## Why the project is useful
This project is useful for those people who like to ask for movie recommendations, and would like to store them in a safe place.  It also allows the user to quickly see the movie poster as well as watch the trailer associated with the movie.  This is great for those users who need their memory jogged or those who want to more aggressively vet the movies they would like to add to their watch list.

## How users can get started with the project
Users can get started with the project by opening up the heroku-deployed link.  Once they do this, they just need to start searching and adding movies to their lists!
